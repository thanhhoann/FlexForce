## 2. The project we are working on

The project's goal is to create a visualization tool for **sorting algorithms**
using React JS. This can also demonstrate some basic features of the sorting
algorithms in DSA. To further enhance the tool, **commitments** from others may
also be acceptable.

To be short, the project aims to:

- []() Visualizing sorting algorithms in action.

- []() Contributing to developing people’s understanding of DSA.

- []() Go through the process of web-tool programming and code refining.

- []() Evaluate the ability to build more features on top of the basic code.

<!-- METHODOLOGY -->

# METHODOLOGY

## 1. Rules

The team tried to build a web screen with simple functions that users can easily
adapt it, here is the summary of the main points:

- []() **Sorting selection**: There are 6 types of sorting algorithms provided,
  including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort,
  and Heap Sort. Users can select one type of the desired sorting to do
  visualization.
- []() **Speed selection**: Provided 3 different speeds, including Slow, Medium,
  and Fast, which are in ascending order of speed values.
- []() **Reset button**: provided for generating a new array for sorting, and
  clearing all the previous actions.
- []() **Sort button**: provided for starting to apply the sorting algorithms to
  the array, also doing visualization corresponding to each sort.
- []() **Visualization area and sorting information**: provided some bar to
  visualize the algorithms and an area to show the information of the algorithm,
  including its time complexity.

- []() Visualization area and sorting information

### b. The game logic

Our final project structure is below:

<img src="src/assets/readme/structure.png" alt="structure">

Initially, the project has been separated into 3 parts: components package,
utils package, and groups of testing applications class for each type of
function class. The components package is the main class that includes almost
our project, it contains styles and UI, which will be described in detail below:

**a) Styles**: Including classes in CSS type

- []() **AlgoInfo**:

- []() **Button**:

- []() **Dropdown**:

- []() **Slider**:

- []() **Toggle**:

- []() **Visualizer**:

**b) UI**: Including classes in javascript (js) type:

- []() **AlgoInfo**:

- []() **Button**:

- []() **Dropdown**:

- []() **Slider**:

- []() **Toggle**:

**c) Visualizer.js**: Including visualization of the algorithms information,
sorting handling (randomly generating array, time limitation), and the basic
algorithm rules of each sort in Javascript.

About the app classes, they will respectively test the class in the type of CSS,
javascript, and reactJS.

## 3. UML Diagram

To better visualize the structure and algorithms, we included the UML diagrams
for the whole project and each group mentioned.

- []()For the whole project:

- []()For the scope: components (without styles package):
